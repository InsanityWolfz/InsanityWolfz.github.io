# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This GitHub Pages repository (**InsanityWolfz.github.io**) hosts a live website designed as a simple yet modern `.io`-style site. It’s automatically deployed from the `main` branch using GitHub Pages.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a minimal yet functional framework for future projects related to coding or gaming. It provides a foundation for experimentation and testing Claude Code features, with plans to expand as new modules or ideas develop.

## Site Layout

- **Top Banner**: Features a login and signup area, plus a link to an About page that explains more about the website.
- **Main Body**: Currently blank, with vertical scrolling enabled so that future modules and features can be easily added and stacked as the project grows.
- **Footer**: Displays the company name (“**InsanityWolfz.io**”) and placeholder social media link buttons (non-functional for now).

## Structure

- **Basic Setup**: Currently includes a `README.md` file and minimal styling.
- **No Build System**: No build tools or additional dependencies configured at this stage.
- **Automatic Deployment**: All changes pushed to the `main` branch (including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or Jekyll content) are deployed immediately to the live GitHub Pages site.

## Development Notes

To make updates or add new modules, simply push changes to the `main` branch. GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild and publish the updated site. This setup is intentionally lightweight to provide maximum flexibility as you refine your vision and integrate new ideas.


### Critical Rules - DO NOT VIOLATE

- **NEVER create mock data or simplified components** unless explicitly told to do so

- **NEVER replace existing complex components with simplified versions** - always fix the actual problem

- **ALWAYS work with the existing codebase** - do not create new simplified alternatives

- **ALWAYS find and fix the root cause** of issues instead of creating workarounds

- When debugging issues, focus on fixing the existing implementation, not replacing it

- When something doesn't work, debug and fix it - don't start over with a simple version
